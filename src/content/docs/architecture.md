# Architecture

Forge is a Rust workspace (12 crates) plus a React/TypeScript frontend. This
doc explains the crate layout, the task state machine, the database, and the
event bus. For runtime configuration see [getting-started.md](/docs/getting-started/);
for the HTTP surface see [api.md](/docs/api/).

### Dependency flow

```
forge-cli → api → services → db
                → events      ↑
          → mcp-server -------┘
          → executors (log schema, shell executor)
          → workspace → git
          → config
          → api-types (shared request/response types, zero internal deps)
```

## Architectural patterns

### Repository trait pattern

The `db` crate defines async traits (`TaskRepo`, `AgentRepo`, …) in
`repository.rs` and implements them all on a single `SqliteDb` struct in
`sqlite.rs`. Services and routes call trait methods as
`TaskRepo::create(&*state.db, ...)`.

### Error propagation chain

`DbError` (db) → `ServiceError` (services) → `ApiError` (api). The api crate's
`errors.rs` maps domain errors to HTTP status codes. All errors render as
`ErrorResponse { code, message, details, request_id }`.

### AppState wiring

`forge-cli/main.rs` creates `Arc<SqliteDb>` and `Arc<EventBus>`, passes them to
`AppState::new()` which constructs `TaskService` and `AgentService` internally.
`AppState` is `Clone` (all fields are `Arc`) and used as Axum state.

### Event bus

The `events` crate wraps `tokio::sync::broadcast`. Services publish
`ForgeEvent` on state changes; the SSE endpoint at `/api/v1/events` subscribes
and streams them to web clients and other listeners.

## Task state machine

```
todo ──────────────► in_progress ──────► review ──────► merging ──────► done
 │                      │                  │              │
 └──► cancelled ◄───────┴──────────────────┴──────────────┘
                                           │
                                      merge_failed ──► blocked
```

All non-terminal states can transition to `cancelled`. Terminal states: `done`,
`cancelled`. The default workflow lives in
`crates/services/src/workflow/default_workflow.rs` with sequence
`backlog → todo → planning → in_progress → review → merging → done` and
`merge_failed`, `blocked`, `cancelled` as auxiliary/failure/terminal states.

### Workflow engine (in progress)

Flexible workflow work is partially implemented. `WorkflowEngine` in
`crates/services/src/workflow/engine.rs` is the new data-driven path;
`TaskService.transition()` still uses the legacy `TaskStatus`/`transition_allowed`
path. Treat the engine as a parallel code path until the split is removed.

Workflows are project-defined JSON in `project.workflow_definition`. Empty
string or `"{}"` resolves at runtime to the built-in `DefaultWorkflow`.
`WorkflowCache` caches resolved definitions per project and invalidates on
workflow updates.

`StateKind` classifies states:

- **`backlog`** — parking lot; agent claims rejected.
- **`initial`** — exactly one per workflow; validation rejects zero or multiple.
- **`active`** — work state; may declare a role such as `coder`.
- **`gate`** — validation/processing state; `gate_config.max_rejections`
  enables retry-budget checks.
- **`terminal`** — absorbing state; outbound transitions and non-terminal
  cancellation targets are rejected.
- **`custom`** — no built-in behavior beyond graph validation.

`WorkflowEngine::transition` lifecycle for `A → B`:

1. Load task, check optimistic version, validate the graph edge or implicit
   cancellation path.
2. Run filtered `A.before_exit` guards unless `B` is the cancellation target;
   `FailurePolicy::Block` failures return `GuardRejection` (HTTP 412).
3. Update `task.status`, increment `version`, write `transition_log`, publish
   `task.status_changed`.
4. Run filtered `A.on_exit`, filtered `B.on_enter`, then effective
   `B.after_enter` hooks. Gate states with `max_rejections` get
   `check_retry_budget` prepended unless already present.
5. Backfill `transition_log.hook_results_json`.
6. If an `after_enter` hook returns `HookResult::Cascade`, recursively
   transition with `triggered_by = "system"`; cascade depth is limited to 3.

Hook audience filtering is uniform across phases. `HookAudience::All` always
runs. `AgentOnly` runs when `triggered_by` starts with `"agent:"` or equals
`"system"`; `UserOnly` runs only when it starts with `"user:"`. Non-matching
hooks are skipped without a hook-result entry.

Cancellation is implicit from any non-terminal state to
`workflow.cancellation_state` (or terminal `"cancelled"` if unset), even
without an explicit edge. Project `before_exit` guards are bypassed for this
path; `on_exit` and cancellation-state `on_enter` hooks still run.

### Roles and assignments

Roles are declared by workflow (`roles[]`) and states can require a role
(`state.role`). Per-task assignments live in `task_role_assignment` keyed by
`(task_id, role_name)` with either `agent_id` or `user_handle`. Claiming
auto-assigns the claimed state's role to the claiming agent when no assignment
exists; a conflicting pre-assignment returns HTTP 409.

`assignee` is an engine-reserved role name. Active states without explicit
`state.role` implicitly bind `assignee`. This fallback applies only to Active
states; Gate, Initial, Backlog, Terminal, and Custom states without roles bind
no role. `state.role = Some("assignee")` on a non-Active state is rejected
during validation. `DefaultWorkflow` is unchanged and uses declared `planner`,
`coder`, and `reviewer` roles.

### Retry budgets

Audit-log derived. Gate states may set `gate_config.max_rejections`;
`check_retry_budget` counts `transition_log` rows with `from_state = gate` and
`rejection = true`, then cascades to `blocked` when exhausted. Generic
user-triggered gate-to-active bounces are logged with `rejection = false` and
do not consume budget.

`transition_log` is the audit source of truth for state changes. The API
exposes it via `GET /api/v1/tasks/{id}/transitions`.

## Happy path

The canonical end-to-end flow is captured by `crates/api/tests/happy_path.rs`.
It boots the in-process Axum router with an embedded daemon and a real temp
git repo, drives a task through `todo → in_progress → review → merging → done`,
and asserts:

- The merge SHA lands on the default branch.
- The worktree is removed.
- One `review` row with `status=passed` is persisted.
- The expected event sequence appears on the bus.

Any refactor that breaks this test likely needs a spec realignment before
merging. Claiming a task auto-dispatches the executor via `tokio::spawn` in
`api::routes::tasks::claim_task` — there is no separate "dispatch" endpoint.

## Concurrency control

Tasks and agents use optimistic concurrency via a `version` column. Updates
require `WHERE version = ?` and increment on success. Version mismatch →
`DbError::VersionConflict` → HTTP 409.

## Database

SQLite with WAL mode. Schema in
`crates/db/migrations/V001__initial_schema.sql`. Migrations are numbered
`V{NNN}__{name}.sql` and tracked in `_migration` table. All primary keys are
app-generated UUID v4; all timestamps are app-generated RFC3339.

Connection pool sets `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`, `journal_mode=WAL`,
`busy_timeout=5000` per connection.

Tables: `project`, `repo`, `agent`, `skill`, `task`, `execution`, `review`,
`task_role_assignment`, `transition_log`, `_migration`.

For tests, use `create_sqlite_pool("sqlite::memory:")` for an in-memory
database.

## Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite + TanStack Query/Router. Source in `web/src/`. Uses
`@` path alias → `web/src/`. API client at `web/src/api/client.ts` calls
`/api/v1/*` endpoints. Types in `web/src/types/generated/api.ts` must match
`api-types` crate responses.

## Crate notes

- **db** — Enum serialization uses `Display`/`FromStr` (in `models.rs`) for
  SQLite TEXT columns. Row mapping is manual via `sqlx::Row::get()`, not
  compile-time checked macros.
- **services** — `TaskService.transition()` handles side effects (event
  emission, counter increments, `ReviewRunner` on `→ review`, `MergeService`
  on `review → merging`, `WorkspaceCleanupScheduler` on `→ done` /
  `→ cancelled`). Background tasks: `CrashRecovery` at startup,
  `HeartbeatMonitor`, `DaemonMonitor`, `WorkspaceCleanupScheduler`.
- **review** — `ReviewRunner` runs `task.review_config.ci_steps` as `bash -lc`
  commands in the worktree; empty steps auto-pass. Creates a `reviewer`-role
  execution sharing the executor's workspace. Depends only on `db`, `events`,
  `executors` — not on `api` or `services`.
- **api** — Routes in `routes/{projects,tasks,agents,repos,executions,events,daemons,clis,profiles,runtimes,executor_types}.rs`.
  Error module is `errors.rs` (plural). Middleware adds request IDs and CORS.
  `claim_task` auto-dispatches the executor.
- **executors** — `LogWriter` appends JSONL with schema version + sequence
  numbers. `ShellExecutor` spawns child processes with heartbeat supervision.
- **mcp-server** — JSON-RPC dispatch over `POST /mcp` with its own `McpState`.
  Does not depend on the `api` crate.
- **workspace** — File-based locking via `.forge.lock`. Path validation
  prevents traversal escapes.
- **config** — `ForgeConfig` with precedence: CLI flags > env vars > config
  file > defaults. Default bind `127.0.0.1:8080`.
